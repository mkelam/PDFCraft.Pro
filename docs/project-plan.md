## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: Kubernetes complexity delaying deployment
**Mitigation**: Start with Docker Compose, migrate to K8s post-MVP
**Contingency**: Use managed services (AWS EKS) to reduce complexity

**Risk**: MuPDF performance targets not achieved
**Mitigation**: PDFium fallback engine already specified in architecture
**Contingency**: Hybrid processing approach with intelligent routing

### Market Risks
**Risk**: Adobe responds with competitive pricing or features
**Mitigation**: Focus on mobile-first and AI differentiation where Adobe is weakest
**Contingency**: Pivot to vertical-specific solutions (legal, healthcare)

### Execution Risks
**Risk**: Team velocity lower than projected
**Mitigation**: Agile methodology with 2-week sprint reviews and course correction
**Contingency**: Scope reduction to core merge/split functionality for faster market entry
